# simple-sqlite-android-app
Sample project to demostrate SQLite implementation in android

### Description
This is a sample Android Studio project with the most basic SQLite implementation
possible. The goal is to clearly see how it works and help you use it. Although it 
uses [Stetho](https://code.facebook.com/posts/393927910787513/stetho-a-new-debugging-platform-for-android/) for Chrome debugging,
it is not essential to the project (I am even moving it to another **simple** demo project)

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/pdrogfer/simple-sqlite-android-app.git simple-sqlite-android-app
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation. Give me a 
star if you find it useful!
